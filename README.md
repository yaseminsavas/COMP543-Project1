The first project of the COMP543: Modern Cryptography, Ko√ß University Fall 2022

Part I: Attacking a shift cipher

In this part, I attacked a shift cipher given the ciphertext using the frequency analysis method.\
I found the key and the plaintext.


Part II: Attacking a vigenere cipher

In this part, I attacked a vigenere cipher given the ciphertext.\
First, I found the key length using Kasiski's method. Then, I, again, used the frequency analysis method.\
I found the key and the plaintext.
